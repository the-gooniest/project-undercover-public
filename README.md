# What is Project Undercover?
Project Undercover is a game about pretending to be an AI. Or at least -- that's part of it. Players will compete against one another, with one side trying to blend in with a crowd of non-player characters, and the other side attempting to identify them. It takes place at a party, and the undercover players are agents trying to infiltrate and complete several missions before the guard, or overseer, catches them. The overseer is limited by a set of cameras, and slowly receives information over the course of the game to help identify the agents, thus putting the heat on them.

It is designed to be a fast-paced party game with a standard session lasting somewhere around 15 minutes, subject to playtesting.
